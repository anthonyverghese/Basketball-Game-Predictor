<!-- The upcoming game choices should be put at the beginning. The user can choose which game they want the prediction for -->




<!-- The graphs should only be displayed once a game is chosen. The first graph will be of points scored in the past -->
<!-- 5-10 games. One team will have dots with the color of its team color (might be hard to do) and the other will --> 
<!-- have dots with the color of its team color as well. We can show this scatter plot and put a straight line, y=x, for easier visualization -->




<!-- The second graph can do the same thing as the first one but compare blocks -->


<!-- The third graph can do the same thing as the first one but compare assists -->


<!-- The fourth graph can do the same thing as the first one but compare three pointers -->




<!-- The algorithm should take into account winning percentage, points scored, whether one team is good at something that the other -->
<!-- is bad at defending (for example three pointers of one team vs. blocks of the other team), recent winning streak, etc. -->
